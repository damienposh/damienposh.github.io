		Knives Chau is a 17-year-old (18-year-old in Volume 6) Chinese-Canadian high school girl and self-described "Scottaholic" (though she later gets over him). Once the doting girlfriend of Scott, he broke up with her after he met Ramona (though he initially "forgot" to break up with her).<br><br><br>
		When she dates Scott, she is initially a quiet, typical school girl. After their break-up, she cut and dyed her hair and changed her clothing style and becomes bitter, obsessed and jealous. She hopes to win Scott back by becoming more of a hipster. Her discovery that Scott was cheating on her with Ramona causes tension between the two girls, sometimes culminating in actual fights, though later the two reach a level of acceptance of one another.
