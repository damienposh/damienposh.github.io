<center><div class="words">This web page is dedicated to over turning the white washed history of cowboys that has been told to us. I have made this page to show people that black people were also cowboys. Many people may not know this but the Lone Ranger was actually a black man. I feel like the media tries to put black people in a box and I felt the need to break that box down. I want black people and other p.o.c. to know that they are more than what is shown to them and that they can be anything they can imagine. For all those out there who identify as a person of color you can submit a photo of you in a cowboy hat to pocyeehaw@gmail.com to get featured on this web page. I would love to see this collection of p.o.c. in cowboy hats to continue forever.</div></center>
